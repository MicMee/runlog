runlog.sh - a personal running log keeper in bash
by tony baldwin 
released according to GPL v. 3
http://tonyb.us/runlog
v. 0.1

Runlog allows you to track the distances, times, and paces, of
your running workouts, plus, if you choose to install the
relevant modules, weight, and blood glucose readings (author
is diabetic). 

Runlog can be used to track cycling, walking, etc., as well,
I suppose.

Installation: run the install script.

Usage:
runlog - creates a new runlog entry.
runlog e filename - opens log entry with filename for editing.
runlog v filename - opens log entry with filename for viewing.
runlog d filename - delete runlog file with filename.
runlog r - reads all entries (cats all files in the dir, pipes to less), can be limited to date parameters
runlog r yyyymmdd - reads entries from date yyyymmdd. One can specify just yyyymm, or just yyyy, even.
runlog l - lists all runlog entries. Like r, it can be narrowed down with date parameters.
runlog s searchterm - searches for searchterm in run entries.
runlog mo YYYYMM - gives a monthly report, total distance, total time, average page, for month YYYYMM (i.e. 201305 = May, 2013)
runlog h - displays this help message.

This is the initial release, and rather rudimentary.
Future releases will include monthly reports, giving average distances, pace,
changes in weight.
I will be borrowing code from my own LJobs.sh script (tonyb.us/ljobs)
and modifying it accordingly, in my copious spare time.
Bear with me (or hack away and submit a push request!)

FRIENDICA POSTING:
Runlog comes with an option to post your run logs to your friendica profile,
and to the @runner group.
What is friendica? Only THE MOST AWESOMEST free, decentralized, federated social networking
platform. See http://www.friendica.com
If you really don't want to use that part, and you are annoyed
by runlog asking if you want to post to friendica upon creation
of each new entry, you could simply delete those parts of the script,
